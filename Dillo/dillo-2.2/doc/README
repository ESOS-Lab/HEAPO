README: Last update Jul 2009

These documents cover dillo's internals.
For user help, see http://www.dillo.org/dillo2-help.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

These documents need a review.
*.txt were current with Dillo1, but many have since become more or
      less out-of-date.
*.doc are doxygen source for the Dillo Widget (dw) component, and
      were written for Dillo2.

They will give you an overview of what's going on, but take them
with a pinch of salt.

 Of course I'd like to have *.txt as doxygen files too!
If somebody wants to make this conversion, please let me know
to assign higher priority to updating these docs.

 * BTW, there's a small program (srch) within the src/ dir. It searches
 tokens within the whole code (*.[ch]). It has proven very useful.
 Ex:  ./srch a_Image_write
      ./srch todo:

 * Please submit your patches with 'hg diff'.


 Happy coding!
