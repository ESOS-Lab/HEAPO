# keysrc
# Sample dillo key bindings file.
#
# The format is: "key = action" or "<modifier>key = action".
# Lines that begin with a '#' are comments.
# The commented-out bindings below show the defaults built into Dillo.
#
# Modifiers recognized: "Shift", "Ctrl", "Alt", "Meta".
# Key names recognized: "Backspace", "Delete", "Down", "End", "Esc",
# "F1" through "F12", "Home", "Insert", "Left", "PageDown", "PageUp",
# "Print", "Return", "Right", "Space", "Tab", "Up".
#
# If Dillo is running under X11, keys whose names are not recognized can
# be specified using their keysym value in hexadecimal. Use xev to get
# the keysym. Example rule: "0x1008ff27 = forward".
#
# The action "nop" (no operation) can be used to remove a binding.
